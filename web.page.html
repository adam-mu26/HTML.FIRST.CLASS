  <h1>Story</h1>
  
  <h1 id="myHeader">Coding is a process of making changes. You start from scratch or already have the old code and need to change it to introduce a new feature or increase maintainability. Working on a code change, you take small steps: create class or function; introduce a variable; add a unit test; refactor something. Every action has some reason and motivation. Therefore, you are writing a small story, where every step is a page with your thoughts and reasons as text and actual code changes as illustrations. That's where our idea for Coding Stories was born. What if one developer could record code changes and reasons behind those changes, and then share their logic to help other developers? With Coding Stories, for example, a senior developer can record an example of successful refactoring and give junior developers a chance to learn how to refactor properly. An engineering student can record steps to solve a task and show their teacher not only the result, but also the reasoning behind the changes. Coding Stories is a solution to help them all improve their skills. It's the best practices of coding and software development.
